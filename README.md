# world-chat feature
Community Server custom development world-chat functionality for Legends of Aria.

This feature permits users to type in a global chat for your community.  Users will be able to initiate chat by typing /wc, /world, /yell or by selecting the chat-channel button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and switching from 'Say' to 'World'.

- World chat is designed to show up in an orange font.

- World chat is not logged against the server logs.  Please use at your own discretion.
